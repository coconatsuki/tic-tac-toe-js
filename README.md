# TIC TIC TOE javascript

A simple app to practice and configure webpack & babel & ESLint.
It was also a good opportunity to practice ES6 for building an interactive front.

To run the app:

```$npm run build
````

It the first time for me to build a app using webpack, and install libraries with npm.
I also learnt how to use modules and export/import them.
This allowed me to have 4 different JS files : The main one (script.js), player.js, ui.js and board.js.
Each of them has a specific role :
- distributing tasks
-instanciate players
- take care of the user interface
- manage the grid.
